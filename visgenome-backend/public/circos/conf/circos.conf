# The chromosomes_unit value is used as a unit (suffix "u") to shorten
# values in other parts of the configuration file. Some parameters,
# such as ideogram and tick spacing, accept "u" suffixes, so instead of
#
# spacing = 10000000
#
# you can write
#
# spacing = 10u
#
# See ticks.conf for examples.

chromosomes_units = 1
# 如果在命令行参数中设置karyotype, 下面两行内容需要注释
# chromosomes_display_default = no
# chromosomes = chrI

# Includes content from ideogram.conf (included file path is relative
# to the file that included it). Conventionally, I separate the 
# contents of the <ideogram> block from circos.conf and include
# it via ideogram.conf.
<<include ideogram.conf>>
 
# Similarly, I put the <ticks> block in ticks.conf
